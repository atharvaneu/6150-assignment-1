### APIs used

- We are using OpenWeather's [Forecast5](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5), which provides realtime weather forecast for next 5 days.
- We are also using OpenWeather's reverse [Geocoding API](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api), this provides us the information of the city and state by taking latitudes and longitudes as input.
